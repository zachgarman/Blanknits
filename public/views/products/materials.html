      <h1>The Blanknits Difference</h1>
      <p class="blanknit-description">
        We are a completely unique type of blanket-design company. We don't use
        specific patterns or recycled designs. At Blanknits, our designs all
        start from scratch in order to create truly one-of-a-kind works of art!
        Our creative process is extremely personal; we utilize your color scheme
        and special occasion and we work with you in order to create the perfect
        design.

      <p class="blanknit-description">
        We can create designs for just about any celebration or event, and we
        have two different lines of blankets that utilize different types of
        yarn to suit your taste. All of our blankets, regardless of the type of
        yarn used, are machine-washable and durable.

      <p class="blanknit-description">
        Our Lamb Blanknits are made with 90% wool and 10% nylon yarn. This
        means you can machine wash and dry this blanket without fear of
        shrinkage or felting. The main color is natural (or off-white) and
        the secondary color is a hand-dyed gradient from red to gold to green
        to blue. This creates an amazing and beautiful one-of-a-kind blanket.
        The wool we use is very soft and does not cause itching.
