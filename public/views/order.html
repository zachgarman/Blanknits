      <h3>Ordering Process</h3>
      <ul class="process">
        <li>
          Fill out our Order Form below. We have three different sizes and two
          different yarn types to choose from.  Choose either a Stork or Lamb
          Blanknit,as well as the size from the drop-down menus.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the Stork Blanknit, please select two colors for the
          yarn.  You can view all our Acrylic Yarns on the
          <a href="/products">Products Page.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Indicate any design elements you would like incorporated (i.e. if
          this is for a baby shower or child's birthday, please include the
          name of the person on the Blanknit).  You can also reference any of
          the Blanknits from our <a href="/gallery">Gallery.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Our Lamb Blanknits come in a gradient of colors that are hand-dyed to
          your specifications.  Please indicate any preferences in the comments
          section, and Margee will work with you to make the perfect Blanknit.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the order form below, complete your payment via PayPal.  We will
          begin the design process as soon as we receive payment. Typically,
          the initial design takes a few days to build, but we will e-mail a
          picture for your Blanknit design as soon as it is ready in order to
          get your approval.
        </li>
        <li>
          If there are any changes you wish to be made, we
          will be happy to revise the design. However, because of the length of
          time involved in the design process, we can only design two revisions
          in addition to the original design; if you are still not satisfied
          with our design after the final revision, we can create additional
          revisions but at additional charges.
        </li>
        <li>
          NOTE: We cannot offer refunds if any
          of the information provided by the customer is incorrect. So please
          double-check to make sure all the information you provide is
          accurate and that all the elements on the final Blanknit are also
          correct.
