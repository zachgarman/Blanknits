      <h3>What kind of yarn do you use?</h3>
      <p>
        For the Stork Blanknits, we use 100% acrylic yarn. For the Lamb
        Blanknits, we use 90% wool and 10% nylon yarns. They are both very easy
        to care for because they can be machine washed and dried. Both styles
        are incredibly soft and warm and will not cause itching. Our yarns come
        in a variety of colors, so be sure to check out our <a class="about-link"
        href="/products/colors">Colors Page</a> to see for yourself.

      <h3>What is the design process like for the Stork Blanknits?</h3>
      <p>
        The process differs depending on the type of Blanknit you order.  For the
        Stork Blanknits, you would first choose two colors and a size for the
        Blanknit. In the comments section, you can describe what you would like
        the Blanknit to look like. We will customize a new design and email you
        a preview of it.  If any changes need to be made, we will be happy to
        revise the design up to two times with no additional charges.  Once we
        agree on a design, the Blanknit will be created and mailed promptly.

      <h3>What is the design process like for the Lamb Blanknits?</h3>
      <p>
        For the Lamb Blanknit, there is no need to choose from two colors. Our
        Lamb Blanknits start as natural, off-white, yarn that is 90% wool and 10%
        nylon. They are then hand-dyed in a gradient color scheme that ranges
        from red to gold to green to blue. Just let us know if you would like
        more or less of each dye color on the finished Blanknit. Be sure to
        check out some of our <a class="about-link" href="/gallery/lamb">Lamb
        Blanknits</a> designs in our gallery.

        4 weeks for delivery. If you need it sooner, we do offer a rush delivery
